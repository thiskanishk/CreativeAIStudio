# AI Architecture for Facebook Ad Creator

This document outlines the architectural design of the AI subsystems within the Facebook Ad Creator platform. It explains how AI models interact with our application and the modular approach we've taken to support multiple vendors.

## Overview

![AI Architecture Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/2HmQuAF.png)

The AI subsystem is designed as a standalone module with a clear orchestration layer. This design allows us to:

1. Abstract AI logic from application logic
2. Switch between different AI providers without affecting the application
3. Support multiple AI tasks (text, image, video, audio) 
4. Enable comprehensive testing, fallback patterns, and versioning

## Core Components

### 1. AI Orchestrator

The orchestrator is the central hub that routes AI requests based on task type, manages provider selection, and handles failures gracefully.

```javascript
// Example usage:
const result = await aiOrchestrator.generateAdCopy({
  productName: "Eco-Friendly Water Bottle",
  productDescription: "Insulated stainless steel bottle...",
  tone: "friendly"
});
```

### 2. Service Layer

The service layer implements specific AI capabilities, regardless of the underlying provider:

- **TextGenerationService**: Handles ad copy generation
- **ImageGenerationService**: Creates and enhances images
- **VideoGenerationService**: Produces video content with animations/effects
- **VoiceGenerationService**: Generates voiceovers

Each service implements a common interface for its domain while abstracting provider-specific details.

### 3. Adapter Layer

Adapters translate our standardized requests into provider-specific API calls:

- **OpenAIAdapter**: Connects to OpenAI API (GPT-4, DALL-E)
- **ReplicateAdapter**: Connects to Replicate for various models
- **ElevenLabsAdapter**: Connects to ElevenLabs for voice generation

Each adapter implements a standard interface for the service it supports.

## AI Tasks and Providers

| Task | Primary Provider | Fallback Provider | Models Used |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Ad Copy Generation | OpenAI | Cohere | GPT-4, Cohere Command |
| Image Enhancement | Replicate | N/A | SDXL, Background Removal API |
| Image Ad Generation | Replicate | N/A | SDXL, Stable Diffusion |
| Video Ad Generation | Replicate/Runway | N/A | Animate Diff, Gen-2 |
| Voice Generation | ElevenLabs | N/A | Various voice models |

## Provider Selection Logic

The orchestrator selects providers based on:

1. **Configuration**: Default provider specified in configuration
2. **User Tier**: Premium users may get access to higher-quality models
3. **Availability**: Automatic fallback if a provider is unavailable
4. **A/B Testing**: Experimental routing for quality evaluation

```javascript
// Example of provider selection logic
function selectProvider(task, userTier, experimentFlag) {
  if (experimentFlag === 'test_new_provider') {
    return 'new_provider';
  }
  
  if (task === 'text' && userTier === 'premium') {
    return 'openai_gpt4';
  } else if (task === 'text') {
    return 'openai_gpt35turbo';
  }
  
  // More selection logic...
}
```

## Asynchronous Job Processing

Many AI tasks (especially image and video generation) are long-running operations. We use an asynchronous job system:

1. Client submits generation request
2. Server returns a job ID immediately
3. Client polls for job status using the job ID
4. When complete, job status includes results or error

```javascript
// Example job status response
{
  "jobId": "gen_12345",
  "status": "completed", // or "processing", "failed"
  "progress": 100,
  "result": {
    "fileUrl": "https://example.com/output.mp4",
    "thumbnailUrl": "https://example.com/thumb.jpg"
  }
}
```

## Prompt Engineering

We use carefully designed prompts for each AI task. These are version-controlled and tested:

### Ad Copy Generation

```
Create a compelling Facebook ad copy for the following product:
Product Name: ${productName}
Product Description: ${productDescription}

The ad copy should be:
- In a ${tone} tone
- Engaging and persuasive
- Include a clear call-to-action
- Maximum length: ${maxLength} characters

Return the content in JSON format with the following structure:
{
  "title": "catchy headline",
  "description": "main ad copy",
  "callToAction": "action phrase"
}
```

### Image Generation

```
Create a Facebook ad for: ${productName}
The ad should have the following characteristics:
- Style: ${style} (${styleDescription})
- Include the text: "${adText.title}" as the headline
- The product description: "${adText.description}"
- Include a call-to-action: "${adText.callToAction}"
- Brand color scheme: ${brandColor}
```

## Error Handling and Retries

The AI system implements sophisticated error handling:

1. Provider-specific error parsing
2. Automatic retries with exponential backoff 
3. Fallback to alternative providers when possible
4. Detailed logging for debugging

## Scaling and Performance

To ensure optimal performance:

1. AI requests are queued and processed based on user tier
2. Results are cached where appropriate
3. Premium users get priority in the processing queue
4. Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements to the AI architecture:

1. **Self-hosted Models**: Integration of open-source models for certain tasks
2. **Fine-tuning**: Custom models trained on ad-specific datasets
3. **Integration with Facebook's Ad API**: For streamlined publishing
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Feedback loop for AI performance optimization
